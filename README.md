# MistyInterface
A very simple iOS app which records speech and sends it to a [`misty-interact`](https://github.com/asteasolutions/misty-interact) server.

The implementation is quick-and-dirty and is meant for testing purposes only. The IP of the server is set as a private constant in `ViewController.swift`.
